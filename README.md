# Interneat
- By the turtle developer

Interneat is a lil' python program I made due to my internet cutting out COMPLETLY for a couple seconds or so every once-and-a-while. This lil program allows me to check how long the downtime is, and maybe find a solution. The name is a pun on "Internet" and "neat" if that wasn't obvious before. Also, it logs all downtime to a JSON file for easy viewing.
